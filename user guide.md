                                                Points and Co-Ordinates


This is the first experiment in the series of  the topic ‘Computer Graphics’. This experiment deals with the basics of computer graphics and is named as ‘Points and Co-ordinate’. Here one can get to know about cartesian plane and coordinates.

    1. Click on the next button to start the experiment.
    2. Read the instructions and click next and previous to navigate with in the instructions.
    3. Click ‘feed coordinates’ to feed in the location of the point and to see its location.
    4. Upon entering the coordinates select any one of the 3 planes to view the point.
    5. Click ‘select a point’ to know the location/coordinates of the selected point.
    6. Upon selecting a point, select any one of the 3 planes to view the point.
    7. Each time you enter a point or select a point you will be asked for scaling factor which will come handy in upcoming experiments.
    8. To start again no need to refresh the page instead you can continue just like that.
